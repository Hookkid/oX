oX is a React boilerplate.
=====================

In the efforts to create a develpment environment that can be quickly initiated and at the same time have cutting-edge DOM manipulator, state management and NO-SQL db, I am building this tool.

It is already functioning as intended although there are imminent upgrades coming.

### Run the example

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/
```
